# ComputerVision
Preliminary Upload for computer vision using OpenCV

  This program is to eventually test stereoscopic vision using open source software (openCV). 
  This program should define a basic principle of the functionality of two cameras to find 
  distance of any object. To perform this task, a stitched up map displaying distances of 
  every pixel will be generated that can then be scanned for particular patterns.

# Development Branch
  This branch is where the magic happens. Testing and implementation of new features occur here using an Xcode C++ environment. After testing the code is merged into master and modified for the final Linux environment and hardware.

#Other Branches
Each branch is labeled by their IDE and Some have been scrapped for focused development on Nvidia Jetson TX1.

Master is to be a "ready to run" C++ executable for our Linux environment

# Installation
  'Clone' the appropriate branch
  'Mod' source code and then push updates to online repository/branch
