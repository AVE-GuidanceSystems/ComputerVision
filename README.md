# ComputerVision_0.1
Preliminary Upload for computer vision using OpenCV

  This program is to eventually test stereoscopic vision using open source software (openCV). 
  This program should define a basic principle of the functionality of two cameras to find 
  distance of any object. To perform this task, a stictched up map displaying distances of 
  every pixle will be generated that can then be scanned for particular patterns.
