# ComputerVision_0.1
Preliminary Upload for computer vision using OpenCV

  This program is to eventually test stereoscopic vision using open source software (openCV). 
  This program should define a basic principle of the functionality of two cameras to find 
  distance of any object. To perform this task, a stictched up map displaying distances of 
  every pixle will be generated that can then be scanned for particular patterns.

# Branches
  Currently branches are diveded by the development environment in which source code was
  created. Not much changes between the existing branches with the execption of the 'Master'
  branch. Visual Studio 2015, XCode and Eclipse are currently being used. 

  Master is to be a "ready to run" c++ executable for our Linux environment

# Installation
  'Clone' the appropriate branch for your IDE
  'Mod' source code and then push updates to online reposity/branch
