# ComputerVision
Preliminary Upload for computer vision using OpenCV

  This program is to eventually test stereoscopic vision using open source software (openCV). 
  This program should define a basic principle of the functionality of two cameras to find 
  distance of any object. To perform this task, a stictched up map displaying distances of 
  every pixle will be generated that can then be scanned for particular patterns.

# Master Branch
  This branch is where the final implementation occurs. Testing and implementation of new features occur in Development Branch using an Xcode C++ environement. After testing the code is merged into master and modified for the final Linux environment and hardware.

  Master is to be a "ready to run" C++ executable for our Linux environment

# Installation
  'Clone' the appropriate branch
  'Mod' source code and then push updates to online reposity/branch
